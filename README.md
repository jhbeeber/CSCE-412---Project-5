# CSCE-412---Project-5
Project 5 is a continuation of Project 4.
Create a serverless website setup and code repositories.
This project enables you to create dynamic websites that can have information pushed to a repository, like Git, and the data becomes available anywhere on the web. 2591 companies reportedly use AWS Lambda in their tech stacks, including Udemy, Delivery Hero, and Nubank.

For this project, you will be using services that charge. The average charge incurred by students last year was under $3.00. 

Overview:
At the core of modern software development is continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery(CD), helping businesses to ship new, working features earlier and more often. This project will expand the secure website from phase 1 with a code repository. Then, by simply
pushing your code to GitHub, your website will automatically be updated.

 

Project Objectives:
You will be able to:
● Show the benefits of CI/CD and the use of code repositories.
● Deploy a secure website on the cloud which can be updated through GitHub.

 

Instructions:
1. This is an individual project, you must turn in your own work.
2. Collaboration for ideas is acceptable, duplication of work is not.
3. Use the account information given with this project.
4. Document the process to update this website.
5. Demo the update process in class.

 

Deliverables:
All deliverables must be at least a minimum viable solution to the problem assigned. No attempt at
grading will be made for non substantial submissions.

Create a document that starts with your secure website. Document the steps necessary to create the
repository and connect it through an AWS CodePipeline. Then document the way you would update
the website.


Give an example of of pre and post changes, complete only by a commit and push to Github. Screenshots are fine.
1. Provide the steps taken from beginning to end to create a dynamically updateable AWS
website using GitHub. It means, your website should update just by making a commit to your GitHub repo.
2. Provide the link to your website.
3. Demonstration pushing a change to your GitHub repo and subsequent changes reflected on your website.

Grading:
This phase is worth 100 points.
Documentation 10%
Use of Git 20%
Successful deployment of appropriate web page as described above 50%
Demonstration 20%

                <h1>Calculator Application</h1>
                <p>The Calculator Application was developed using a mixture of Java, JavaFX, and FXML. It uses a Graphical User Interface that allows the user to press different buttons and complete simple calculations. While the project is currently in a working condition, it is still in development to allow for more complicated calculations. This project was started back in March 2023.</p>

                <h1>Instagram Follower Application</h1>
                <p>The Instagram Follower Application was developed using Java, JavaFX, and FXML. The application compares the following and follower HTML lists that are provided by Instagram to generate a list of accounts that you follow but don't follow you back (non-reciprocal followers). This personal project utilized a custom graphical user interface to display the list of accounts. This project was started back in April 2023 and was finished in June 2023.</p>

                <h1>StarSpace</h1>
                <p>This galaxy simulator was a group project for the Spring 2022 TAMUHack back in January 2022. It utilized Unity, C# scripts, and nodes in order to distribute 1000+ stars around a black hole. Through the two days, the group collaborated and submitted a product that was fully playable and allowed for an interactive experience for the user. Due to some optimization issues, we weren’t able to present our full product , as the generation of planets around each of the stars didn’t run efficiently enough on our laptops.</p>

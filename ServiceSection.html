                <h1>Improper Waste Disposal</h1>
                <p>Improper Waste Disposal was a social media project that aimed to raise awareness and promote proper waste disposal. The project consisted of a digital infographic, Instagram stories and posts, and a clean up event in the Northside of campus. Originally, I desired for the audience to be more widespread, but I decided to narrow it to fellow Aggies in order to meet the goals in a specified timeframe. Some of the ideas that were pushed were increased recycling, and proper disposal of electronics and batteries (big environmental impact). The posts and the clean up event to end the project helped illustrate the Aggie core values, mainly Selfless Service and Integrity.</p>

                <h1>Dickens on Main</h1>
                <p>Dickens on Main is a Christmas event in the town of Boerne, Texas. People from all over the state (and from neighboring states) come down and try the different assortments of food, learn about the town's German heritage, listen to live music, and ride horse carriages. I volunteered at this event for over three years, helping organize the different entertainment stalls and running it during the night. Being able to not only serve my community, but also bring excitement to families has been everlasting. I usually dedicate a couple weeks and weekends to help organize the event, then I would volunteer at the event for one weekend. It has been amazing working with the organization that helps unite our community.</p>

                <h1>Hill Country Daily Bread</h1>
                <p>Hill Country Daily Bread is a non-profit religious center that focuses on spreading the faith, and providing outreach programs and events. They are based in Boerne, Texas, and set up many different charity events every year. I volunteered at this organization and helped design digital inspirational cards that would be sent with food packages for those in need. I also got to hand deliver these cards to people which brought a smile to my face. Being able to give back to the community through digital design (and improve my skills) has been incredibly impactful and has helped me showcase some of the Aggie Core values, such as Selfless Service and also Respect. Despite how divided the general public may seem, small acts of kindness goes a long way to bringing everyone back together again.</p>

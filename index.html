            <h1>TESTING THE PIPELINE!</strong></h1>
            <p>Howdy! I am James Beeber and I am a third year Computer Science student attending Texas A&M University. Here, you will find my technical portfolio, resume, and other helpful links. Growing up, I loved to volunteer and make others smile in my community. I decided to pursue Computer Science because it would allow me to have a larger impact on, not just those in my local community, but across national borders as well. I have customer service experience as I have worked as a host at a restaurant. It was there, where I built upon my teamwork and time management skills, attributes that I believe will benefit my work environment. Recently, I have picked up some other hobbies, including Ultimate Frisbee and photography.</p>

                <h1>Downtown Austin, 2020</h1>
                <p>This photo was taken at a local cafe in downtown Austin, Texas. It was taken during my Spring Break right before the COVID-19 shutdown back in March 2020. This photo brings back memories of what life was like before the Pandemic occurred and how it changed our way of life. It also reminds me to be more appreciative of everything I have because things can change in an instant. You never truly know how much you have until it is all gone.

                <h1>Colorado River, 2021</h1>
                <p>This photo was taken from a trail overlooking the *Texas* Colorado River near Austin, Texas. You can see the beautiful city skyline in the background, despite the added camera blur. It was taken during the later stages of the Pandemic, back in 2021, therefore the trails and river weren't as crowded as before. Despite all the negatives that came with the Pandemic, taking walks were very peaceful and allowed you to really appreciate the nature around you.

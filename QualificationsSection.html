            <h1>Technical Skills</h1>
            <p>The languages I am proficient in are C++, Java, and Python. I learned C++ and Python mainly through university courses, such as ENGR 102 and CSCE 121. Even though I learned Java back in high school, CSCE 314 allowed me to refine my skills and apply it to JavaFX. I am familiar with and have experience with C# and SQL due to personal projects that I have completed over the years. I also have experience in Adobe Products such as Illustrator and Photoshop, and have used these skills on some graphic design projects such as magazine covers.</p>

            <h1>Technical Interests</h1>
            <p>I am most interested in Software Engineering, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence. Becoming a fullstack developer and working on applications has always been a dream of mine as it enables you to have a wide amount of impact on those around you. I am also interested in Artificial Intelligence because it is being regarded as the future of the industry and seeing the current implications on it illustrates how significant it will be on, not only the economy, but others' lives. Being able to positively impact that part of the industry and work on developing artificial intelligence that benefits the general public would be amazing and fulfill my dream of helping others. And currently, I am working as a Data Analyst and Quality Assurance Agent at Telus International, allowing me to gain experience in data analysis and the parsing of user data/queries. Because of this job, I would definitely be interested in learning more about Data Science and Data Analysis.</p>

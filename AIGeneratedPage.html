            <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, language understanding, and decision-making.</p>

            <h2>Capabilities of AI</h2>
            <p>AI has the potential to revolutionize various industries and impact individuals in numerous ways. It can enhance efficiency, automate repetitive tasks, provide personalized recommendations, and make data-driven decisions. AI technologies like machine learning and natural language processing are already transforming healthcare, finance, and entertainment, among others.</p>

            <h2>How AI Affects Developers</h2>
            <p>Software engineers are profoundly affected by AI as it opens up new opportunities and challenges. Developers can leverage AI to streamline software development, automate testing, and enhance user experiences. AI-powered tools can assist in code generation and debugging. However, developers must also adapt to evolving AI technologies and consider ethical implications when building AI-powered systems.</p>

                <h3>Project: StarSpace</h3>
                <p>A Hackathon project that utilizes C# scripts to create a galaxy simulator. StarSpace allows users to explore the vastness of space, simulate celestial events, and learn about astronomy in an interactive way.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="portfolio-item">
                <h3>Project: Improper Waste Disposal</h3>
                <p>A social media campaign aimed at promoting proper waste disposal practices. This project leveraged Instagram, digital flyers, and a community cleanup event to raise awareness about the importance of responsible waste management.</p>

        <h3>Prompt</h3>
        <p>Create a file containing both HTML and CSS code in it. The webpage is going to be a technical portfolio for a computer science student. Include a navigation bar that has five internal links: "index.html", "TechnicalPortfolio.html", "QualificationsSection.html", "ServiceSection.html", "AIGeneratedPage.html". Add the title, "AI Generated Page" and create a description explaining what artificial intelligence is. Then create the subheading "Capabilities of AI" and create a description explaining what artificial intelligence can do for the world and individuals. Then create another subheading called "How AI Affects Developers" and create a description that explains how software engineers are affected by AI and how they can use it. Under this, create a mini portfolio, with the title "James Beeber" that lists out two projects that I have completed (with titles and descriptions). The first project is named "StarSpace", and it was a Hackathon project that uses C# scripts to create a galaxy simulator. The second project is "Improper Waste Disposal" which was a social media campaign that pushed proper waste disposal using Instagram, digital flyers, and a cleanup event.</p>
